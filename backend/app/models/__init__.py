"""
SQLAlchemy ORM Models.

This package contains database models using SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax.
All models use the declarative mapping with Mapped[] type hints.

Models:
- User: GitHub OAuth user data and session info
- CachedData: Cached GitHub API responses

Note: Imports are commented out until the actual model files are created in Phase 2.
"""

# These will be uncommented in Phase 2 when the models are created:
# from app.models.user import User
# from app.models.cache import CachedData

# __all__ = ["User", "CachedData"]
__all__: list[str] = []
